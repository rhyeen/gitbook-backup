# Velocity





* Different engineers have different velocities.  Low velocities can be because engineers are working on more complex tasks generally than their peers and  not correctly estimating, over confidence, bad scoping and planning of requirements, actually not working, [glue work](https://noidea.dog/glue).



### Software Engineering Best Practices

> The strongest advice I can give you, however, is to adopt the full Circle of Life, including, and most especially, the technical practices. Far too many teams have adopted the outer business ring and have found themselves in the trap that Martin Fowler has labeled “[Flaccid Scrum](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html).” The symptoms of this disease are a slow decline from high productivity in the early days of a project to very low productivity as the project wears on. The reason for this loss of productivity is the corruption and degradation of the code itself.\

> It turns out that the business practices of Agile are a highly efficient way to make a very large mess. Furthermore, if you don’t take care of the cleanliness of the structure you are building, then the mess will slow you way down. So, pick one of the methods or none of the methods. Ensure that you address all the disciplines in the Circle of Life. Get the team to agree. Then, begin. Remember courage, communication, feedback, and simplicity you regularly adjust the disciplines and behaviors. Don’t ask for permission. Don’t stress about “doing it right.” Just work through the issues as they arise and continue to drive your projects to the best possible outcome.
