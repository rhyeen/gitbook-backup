# Closing Thoughts

### Deadlines

#### Work harder

Aka, put in more hours.

#### Add resources

Aka, pulling additional engineers into a project.  which is [usually a bad idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Mythical\_Man-Month)

### Software Engineering Best Practices

> The strongest advice I can give you, however, is to adopt the full Circle of Life, including, and most especially, the technical practices. Far too many teams have adopted the outer business ring and have found themselves in the trap that Martin Fowler has labeled “[Flaccid Scrum](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FlaccidScrum.html).” The symptoms of this disease are a slow decline from high productivity in the early days of a project to very low productivity as the project wears on. The reason for this loss of productivity is the corruption and degradation of the code itself.\

> It turns out that the business practices of Agile are a highly efficient way to make a very large mess. Furthermore, if you don’t take care of the cleanliness of the structure you are building, then the mess will slow you way down. So, pick one of the methods or none of the methods. Ensure that you address all the disciplines in the Circle of Life. Get the team to agree. Then, begin. Remember courage, communication, feedback, and simplicity you regularly adjust the disciplines and behaviors. Don’t ask for permission. Don’t stress about “doing it right.” Just work through the issues as they arise and continue to drive your projects to the best possible outcome.

<summary>Burn-down chart</summary>

A burn-down chart is essentially a way to visually see the progress you make on a milestone with the goal of eventually "burning down" enough of the work that there is nothing left to do and the task is complete.

I've never seen a burn-down chart actually help anyone.  Sure, they're pretty to look at and give a sense of accomplishment to the engineers and control to the product managers, but their benefit is superficial and usually outweighed by their inaccuracy as you continue to add more wood (tasks) to the fire.  Even worse, when the burn-down trends towards a later completion date than expected, it can be abused to justify artificial [deadlines](closing-thoughts.md#undefined).

Lastly, a burn-down chart encourages teams to work on one feature set (story) at a time, which is not very agile.

### Choose your own adventure

\*\*\*Should caveat that everything we're going to demonstrate is just an example of how to do things.  The biggest pitfall regarding agile development is assuming there is a single "correct" way.  If you forget about the higher level vision of what agile provides, then it becomes work for the sake of work rather than an actual benefit to the engineering teams.  You should talk with the engineers frequently to ensure whatever method you employ works for them.  And, because I believe agile development planning is something that should be done at the team level (and no higher), each team should feel free to adopt whatever style best fits their needs.  It's best to keep consistency across an org, as engineers tend to move teams and will need to collaborate across teams, but it's also good to note that different teams tackle engineering problems differently: because of its members and because of its problem space.
