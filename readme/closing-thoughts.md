### Choose your own adventure

\*\*\*Should caveat that everything we're going to demonstrate is just an example of how to do things.  The biggest pitfall regarding agile development is assuming there is a single "correct" way.  If you forget about the higher level vision of what agile provides, then it becomes work for the sake of work rather than an actual benefit to the engineering teams.  You should talk with the engineers frequently to ensure whatever method you employ works for them.  And, because I believe agile development planning is something that should be done at the team level (and no higher), each team should feel free to adopt whatever style best fits their needs.  It's best to keep consistency across an org, as engineers tend to move teams and will need to collaborate across teams, but it's also good to note that different teams tackle engineering problems differently: because of its members and because of its problem space.
