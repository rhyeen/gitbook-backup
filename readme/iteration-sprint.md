  The iteration is the heart of agile development as it gives structure to team
  planning.  I'll be guiding you through how to setup and manage your team's
  iterations with an example structure.

# Iteration/Sprint

Although [some may argue](https://rhyeen.gitbook.io/techops/v/time-management/#what-agile-development-solves-and-what-it-doesnt.) that there is a difference between an iteration and a sprint, know that they are both generally used in the industry as a term for a (usually) 1-2 week continually repeated timeframe in which a team scopes, locks in, then accomplishes tasks.  The iteration is punctuated with a planning meeting to start off the iteration and close out the previous iteration, and is sprinkled with very short check-in (Stand up) meetings (we'll [talk more about meetings](weekly-meetings.md) later).  We use a Kanban board ([more on that later](kanban-boards.md)) and other techniques to keep track of progress and prioritize tasks during an iteration.  Finally, we track longterm trends in the iteration to improve the process.

#### Project Management Software

Let's dive into defining an iteration and its different structures.  To keep our examples practical, we'll be demonstrating these principles using [Trello](https://trello.com) and [GitHub Projects (beta)](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/trying-out-the-new-projects-experience/about-projects).  We chose Trello as an example because it's no-frills clean, simple, and free.  We chose GitHub Projects as an example because that's what we use at [PocketRN](https://pocketrn.com).

### What about Jira?  Or {{ insert of tool here}}?

Jira is a great tool for turning the agile development into a bureaucratic nightmare.  Don't get me wrong; it's definitely the most common and powerful project management tool out there.  But with great power comes great amount-of-superficial-features-that-management-abuses-turning-the-benefits-of-agile-development-into-a-redtaped-gridlock-of-omg-I-just-want-to-create-a-#!$\&ing-ticket!.

More seriously, there are a ton of tools out there that can be used.  I recommend any that are specifically built to benefit your engineers rather than management or other business units.  If a tool has features (dashboards, reports, metrics, etc.) that can be used to shame an engineer into working harder, don't use that tool.  We chose GitHub Projects specifically because only engineers have GitHub accounts.

## Defining your iteration

### Establishing meetings

{% hint style="info" %}
### Should my team have a 1 or 2-week iteration?

I've done both.  For partially or fully remote teams, I highly recommend 1-week iterations with minimal other [weekly meetings](weekly-meetings.md).  I've found that team members may often grind against a problem unnecessarily longer when working remotely, because it takes more effort to validate with another teammate when they are not sitting next to you.

For mostly or fully physically adjacent teams, I recommend a 2-week iteration as you can spread the [weekly meetings](weekly-meetings.md) out across 2 weeks, giving your engineers more time for deep work.

Velocity

* Different engineers have different velocities.  Low velocities can be because engineers are working on more complex tasks generally than their peers and  not correctly estimating, over confidence, bad scoping and planning of requirements, actually not working, [glue work](https://noidea.dog/glue).
