# Practical Agile Development

Agile Software Development is synonymous with Software Development.  I was introduced to the methodology in school and have used it in every job since then.  Every software engineer in the industry is familiar with the agile methodology, and although there are many competing methodologies ([Waterfall, Lean, etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_software\_development\_philosophies)), most business run processes derived from "Agile", whether that's scrum, iterations (sprints), story points, velocity, burn down, and so on.

Despite how universally familiar this industry is with agile development, and despite how many high-level resources we have (just Google, "Agile Software Development"), I have yet to find a succinct resource that distills an effective solution for applying the agile methodology.  In this article, I intend to resolve that by providing a comprehensive guide on how I have successfully applied agile development with my software teams.
