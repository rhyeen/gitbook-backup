# Practical Agile Development

Agile Software Development is synonymous with Software Development. I was introduced to the methodology in school and have used it in every job since then. Every software engineer in the industry is familiar with the agile methodology, and although there are many competing methodologies ([Waterfall, Lean, etc.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_software\_development\_philosophies)), most businesses run processes derived from "Agile", whether that's scrum, iterations (sprints), story points, velocity, burn down, and so on.

Despite how universally familiar this industry is with agile development, and despite how many high-level resources we have on the topic (just Google, "Agile Software Development"), I have yet to find a succinct resource that distills an effective solution for applying the agile methodology. In this article, I intend to resolve that by providing a comprehensive guide on how I have successfully applied agile development with my software teams.

### What agile development solves and what it doesn't.

Because the agile methodology has fully saturated the tech industry, it has been construed to fit business expectations by marketing and over promising.  The [original principles](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) of the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org) have largely been lost in the flood of technical jargon and overpromises fabricated by business opportunists looking to turn a profit ([just listen to Uncle Bob](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BOSpxYJ9M), one of the father's of the agile principles, on just that topic).

What's this caused is a false snake-oil belief that what agile development solves is a way to increase the productivity of software engineers in a way that is transparent and measured and accountable.  The hope being that if you can effectively keep engineers focused on measurable tasks and track that progress, you can create more feature output and therefore increase your business value.

Although it can be argued that a particular application of agile development (known as Agile, with a capital "A") does indeed increase the output of features, I would strongly argue ([with other voices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JNXx8VdbAE)) against such practices as they directly distract from increasing meaningful business outcomes.  More output â‰  more profit.

Instead, consider agile development to be a set of guiding principles that will help your engineering teams better coordinate, better pivot, and better understand how their work is contributing to the greater business goals.  In essence, agile development is about:

* knowing where you and your team are working,
* defining steps to reaching your collective goals,
* learning through qualitative and quantitative data,
* and pivoting with agility when needed.

_TL;DR: agile development is **not** to improve productivity or accountability, but rather to improve the process of software implementation._

* Sprint/Iteration Planning
* Story Points
* Velocity

### What we will NOT cover

This article is specifically focused on the aspects of agile development regarding business planning and practices rather than software engineering practices.  Topics such as Test Driven Development (TDD), the SOLID Principles, Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD), Pair Programming, Code Review, Acceptance Tests, etc. are topics worthy of their own research.  For a great grasp of the "why" these topics are just as important, I'd highly recommend picking up [Clean Agile](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Agile-Basics-Robert-Martin/dp/0135781868).
